Small Projects On Which I have Worked On when learning PYTHON
1) Guess The Number Game -> guess_number.py
   DESCRIPTION -> This is a simple number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The program provides 
                  feedback based on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or out of the given range.
   USAGE -> i) Run the script
            ii) Enter the start and end values to define the range for the random number.
            iii) Keep guessing until you guess the correct number.
2) Password Generator -> random_password.py
   DESCRIPTION -> This script generates a random password of a specified length. The password includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special 
                  characters.
   USAGE -> i) Run the script.
            ii) Enter the desired length for the password.
            iii) The script will output a randomly generated password of the specified length.
3) Banking System -> banking_system.py
   DESCRIPTION -> This project is a simple banking system simulation with basic functionalities like crediting and debiting an account. It includes a parent 
                     class Account and a child class Bank that extends Account.
